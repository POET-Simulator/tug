Welcome to Tug's documentation!
===============================
Welcome to the documentation of the TUG project, a simulation program 
for solving one- and two-dimensional diffusion problems with heterogeneous diffusion coefficients, more 
generally, for solving the following differential equation

.. math::
   \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \alpha_x \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + \alpha_y \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2}.
