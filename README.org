#+TITLE: Diffusion module

This is the according repository to the diffusion module we discussed earlier.
With this readme I will document all my steps I've done and will do.

* Current State

- 1D diffusion is possible by setting bc at left/right end by hand or use the
  default value (Neumann with gradient 0)
- Always set concentrations/diffusion coefficients by using std::vector
- simple datastructure, which is currently just a class called *BTCSDiffusion*

* ToDos

- [ ] keep sparse matrix in memory
- [ ] allow different boundary conditions at the ends and also inside the grid
- [ ] implement 2D diffusion
