#+TITLE: Diffusion module

This is the according repository to the diffusion module we discussed earlier.
With this readme I will document all my steps I've done and will do.

* Current State

- 1D diffusion is possible by setting bc at left/right end +by hand+ by =setBoundaryCondition()= or use the
  default value (Neumann with gradient 0)
- +Always set concentrations/diffusion coefficients by using std::vecto+
- Set concentrations of ghost zones by defining them via a list tuples.
  + index 0 points to the left ghost zone
  + index 1 to the right ghost zone
- simple datastructure, which is currently just a class called *BTCSDiffusion*

* ToDos

- [X] keep sparse matrix in memory
- [-] allow different boundary conditions at the ends and also inside the grid
- [ ] implement 2D diffusion
